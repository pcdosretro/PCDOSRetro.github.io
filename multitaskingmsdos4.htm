<title>Information about the little known multitasking MS-DOS 4.0</title>

<p>
Multitasking MS-DOS 4.0 was a little known and separate development of DOS done in parallel with the development of DOS 3.0 and 3.1 and was released in late 1985. It should not be confused with the later retail DOS 4.0 that was released in 1988. DOS 4.0 supported preemptive multitasking, shared memory, semaphores, advanced memory management, a session manager, imports, exports and a new executable format. Many of the ideas and features introduced here found their way into OS/2. 
Unfortunately DOS 4.0 was limited by the real-mode 8086 environment and the 640KB address space. Also programs which were not well-behaved or relied upon undocumented DOS functions would not run properly under DOS 4.0, particularly TSR programs. Despite these limitations Microsoft wanted to make DOS 4.0 a retail product but IBM at the time was not interested in such a version of DOS, instead they formed a joint development agreement with Microsoft which resulted in the development of OS/2 1.0. 
Microsoft licensed DOS 4.0 to several European OEMs including Goupil but it was never shipped in North America.

Microsoft released an updated version, DOS 4.1 in late 1987 for the British company International Computers Limited (ICL) for use with their PC/AT compatible DRS Professional Work Station (PWS). DOS 4.1 incorporated features from DOS 3.2. Like its predecessor, DOS 4.1 was never shipped in North America.

INT 21h functions 58h and 5D06h not supported
new INT 21h functions:
    61h: unknown function (not path parse)

    8400h-8402h: shared memory functions
    8500h-8504h: semaphore functions
    86h: set handle count
    87h: get process id
    8801h-8802h: unknown get/set function (handle related)

    96h: unknown function
    97h: unknown function
    98h: unknown function
    99h: unknown function
INT 21h functions 1Fh and 32h copy the DPB to DS:BX instead of returning a pointer in DS:BX
INT 21h function 25h does not directly set interrupt vectors
device driver command codes 00h-10h (same as DOS 3.x) and 11h-16h (new)
new device driver command codes:
    11h: stop console output
    12h: restart console output
    13h: generic ioctl (same as DOS 3.2+)
    14h: unknown
    15h: unknown
    16h: unknown
SYSVARS table:
    00h DPB pointer (DPB length = 18h)
    04h SFT pointer (SFT length = 37h)
    08h CLOCK$ device pointer
    0Ch KEYBD$ device pointer
    10h SCREEN$ device pointer
    14h disk buffer size
    16h disk buffer chain pointer
    1Ah ? (always 0, CDS pointer should be here)
    1Eh FCB SFT pointer
    22h FCB keep count
    24h drive count
    25h switch character
    26h ? (code pointer)

no MCB anchor at SYSVARS-2
MCBs have previous MCB at 06h and next MCB at 08h (same seg as MCB = start/end of chain)
InDOS flag is always FFh and the critical error flag does not precede it
KEYBD$ and SCREEN$ in addition to CON
no INT 28h or INT 2Ah function 84h idle callout
no INT 2Ah critical section support
no INT 2Fh redirector support
no job file table in PSP
INT 12h (40h:13h) value is altered to limit session memory
CONFIG.SYS commands: BREAK, BUFFERS, COUNTRY, DEVICE, FCBS, FILES, LASTDRIVE, SHELL (same as DOS 3.1)
additional internal commands: CALL, DETACH (DET), ENDLOCAL, EXTPROC, MEMSET, SETLOCAL
NE format executables supported
no PSP created for NE executables
