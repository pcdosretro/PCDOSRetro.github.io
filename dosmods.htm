<h4>This is a detailed list of the changes I made in PC DOS 7.0</h4>
</div>
<div style="font-family:sans-serif;font-size:small">
<b>IBMBIO.COM</b>
<ul>
<li>Decreased the number of resident floppy drive tables from 4 to 2 saving 200 bytes. Additional floppy drive tables will be added dynamically if 3 or 4 floppy drives are present.
<li>Build A20 compare pointers inline instead of loading them from memory. Also building the pointers is faster than loading them.
<li>Use indirect near call instead of direct far call in INT 6Ch power management handler so that far call check A20 entry can be deleted.
<li>Deleted unreferenced disable A20 routine.
<li>Added assume DS to clock device routine (daycnt_to_day) saving 27 bytes due to unneeded CS overrides.
<li>Moved the clock device routines (daycnt_to_day and bin_to_bcd) from the resident portion to the relocatable portion which loads in the HMA and and combined them saving 193 bytes.
<li>Deleted month_table and modified power management read date routine to use smaller month_tab saving 24 bytes.
<li>Moved constants fat_12_id, fat_16_id, and vol_no_name from the resident portion to the relocatable portion which loads in the HMA saving 30 bytes.
<li>Deleted duplicate null volser definition (NO NAME).
<li>Deleted duplicate translations in disk error code table.
<li>Defined BPB array table in tracktable area which is unused at init time saving 52 bytes.
<li>Call EnsureA20on instead of separate IsA20off and EnableA20 routines.
<li>Optimized INT 2Fh path by jumping directly to interrupt handler routine instead of using indirect jump.
<li>Deleted pseudo disk parameter table (sm92) and loaded values inline.
<li>Disabled interrupts while updating INT 13h and 19h vectors in INT 2Fh function 13h code.
<li>Added CONFIG.SYS command DOSDATA=UMB to allow the DOS system tables (FILES,FCBS,BUFFERS,LASTDRIVE,STACKS) to be moved to upper memory. Windows verifies that at least 10 SFTs are available by opening CON 10 times and searching the first 512K twice for 5 occurrences of 'CON ' assuming that each occurrence is an SFT entry. Since Windows doesn't verify that each occurrence is actually in an SFT it can be fooled into loading when DOSDATA=UMB is in effect by storing 5 'CON ' strings in the DOS console input buffer during startup (INT 2Fh function 1605h).
<li>Added ESC to selective startup prompt.
<li>Added support for preloading DRVSPACE.BIN and STACKER.BIN.
</ul>
<b>IBMDOS.COM</b>
<ul>
<li>Removed 255-byte unused area FAKE_COUNT from the DOS data area and moved AuxSft into newly freed area saving 59 bytes.
<li>Use REP MOVSD when copying data to and from the HMA transfer buffer when buffers are in the HMA by checking the 386 flag in the DOS data area.
<li>Aligned DOS HMA interrupt vector jump table on a doubleword boundary for faster access.
<li>Reverted to DOS 5.0 behavior of not flushing buffers immediately after releasing a FAT chain because of noticeable slowdown on DEL command.
<li>Fixed bug which caused infinite loop when trying to create a temp file in a full root directory (INT 21h function 5Ah).
<li>Fixed bug which caused INT 21h functions 65A0h-65A2h to not work.
<li>Optimized code in EXEPATCH.ASM to decrease kernel code size.
<li>Optimized INT 21h function 33h code to decrease kernel code size.
<li>Correctly initialize disk volume change flag to -1 instead of 0.
</ul>
<b>COMMAND.COM</b>
<ul>
<li>Added /H option to load COMMAND.COM and its environment into upper memory.
<li>Add /O option to COMMAND.COM to disable the overwrite prompt on COPY, XCOPY, and MOVE commands.
<li>Moved init time message "Top level process aborted, cannot continue" out of resident portion saving 48 bytes.
<li>Moved output redirection filename to the transient portion of COMMAND.COM saving 80 bytes (input redirection filename was already there).
<li>Merge QueryA20 and EnableA20 routines inline into CheckA20 routine.
<li>Documented TRUENAME command in online help.
<li>Made commonly used PROMPT $P$G the default setting.
<li>Reset extended error message sublist so transient isn't reloaded needlessly.
<li>Deleted duplicated "Bad command or file name" message from resident portion.
<li>Moved loadhigh UMB variables to common data area (MsgBuffer/SafePathBuffer) saving 48 bytes.
<li>Combined common resident substitution list data.
<li>Added support for REXX batch files.
<li>Added ESC to selective startup prompt.
<li>Reduced size of arg parse buffer from 256 bytes to correct size of 128 bytes.
<li>Combined arg buffer and temp buffer saving 128 bytes.
</ul>
<b>ANSI.SYS</b>
<ul>
