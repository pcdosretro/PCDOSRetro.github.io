<p><b>Syntax:</b></p>
<pre>
BOOTLDR [INSTALL|SAVE]

INSTALL will install the boot loader code onto the MBR.
SAVE will save the contents of the boot sector to the file BOOT.BIN.
If no parameter is specified then the partition table is displayed.
</pre>
<p>Once installed when the computer is booted, the valid partitions will be listed. For example:</p>
<pre>
  F1 DOS
* F2 NTFS
</pre>
<p>Pressing the appropriate function key (F1-F4) will boot the specified partition. Pressing Enter or waiting 5 seconds will boot the active partition (indicated by an asterisk). Pressing A will attempt to boot from the first floppy drive.</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Recognized partition types:</b>
<dt>01 DOS (FAT12)
<dt>04 DOS (FAT16)
<dt>06 DOS (FAT16, &gt;32MB)
<dt>07 NTFS
<dt>0B FAT32
<dt>0C FAT32 (LBA)
<dt>0E VFAT (FAT16, LBA)
<dt>83 LINUX
</dl>
<p>Unrecognized partitions types are listed as ? but may still be booted. Extended partitions (types 05 and 0F) are skipped as these are not bootable by convention.</p>
<p><b>Technical notes:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>When BOOTLDR is installed, only the first 440 bytes of the MBR are altered. The remaining bytes including the 4-byte NT disk signature at 1B8h are unchanged.</li>
<li>BOOTLDR uses EDD INT 13h function 42h to read the selected partition boot sector if available, otherwise standard INT 13h function 02h is used.</li>
<li>When a partition is selected the MBR is rewritten with that partition marked as the active partition.</li>
<li>BOOTLDR will check for a valid partition ID (55h AAh) at the end of the sector before transferring control to the partition boot code which is loaded at 0:7C00h.</li>
</ul>
